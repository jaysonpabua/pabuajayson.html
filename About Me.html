        Hi! I’m Jayson Pabua, a Christian from the Philippines. I am a person who believes in hard work, faith, and perseverance. My dream is to become an agricultural engineer and a pilot someday. I want to use my knowledge and skills to help people, especially farmers, improve their way of living. At the same time, I also want to explore the skies and experience the joy of flying. I believe that with dedication and God’s guidance, I can achieve my dreams.
