            <h2>Hello</h2>
            <h3>Here's who I am</h3>
        <p>My name is <strong>Jayson Pabua</strong> — 16 years old, from New Mahayag, Catbalogan City, Samar. I'm currently a Senior High School student in Silanga National High School.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite Bible verses is Proverbs 3:5 that says: “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not depend on your own understanding.”</p>

      <h3>Singer</h3>
      <p>I love singing because it gives me strength. I use this talent in church during Sunday services to praise the Lord Jesus.</p>

      <h3>Dancer</h3>
      <p>I used to dance before, maybe during the pandemic when I was in elementary. I stopped for a while, but when I became Grade 9, I joined cultural presentations again as one of the dancers.</p>

      <h3>Composer</h3>
      <p>I recently found out that I can actually write song lyrics. I was able to create those lyrics with the help of my classmates.</p>
